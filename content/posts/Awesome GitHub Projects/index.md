### üìå Project: [OctoBot](https://github.com/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot)

**Description:**  
OctoBot is an open-source cryptocurrency trading bot designed to provide flexible, automated trading strategies. It supports multiple exchanges, offers backtesting capabilities, and enables both beginners and advanced users to experiment with algorithmic trading.  

**Why It‚Äôs Interesting:**  
OctoBot stands out because it integrates AI-powered prediction models into trading strategies. Most notably, it allows users to connect to **custom LLMs** via a configurable base URL‚Äîmaking it possible to use alternatives beyond OpenAI models. This flexibility includes support for local AI setups like **Ollama**, which means traders can experiment with running their own prediction models locally. Such extensibility opens the door to more privacy, cost efficiency, and creativity in designing AI-driven trading systems.  

**Tech Stack:**  
- Languages: Python  
- Tools: Docker, AsyncIO, WebSocket, REST APIs  

**Key Features:**  
- Custom **LLM base URL** for predictions (connect to any AI model, not only OpenAI)  
- Seamless integration with **Ollama** for local LLM trading predictions  
- Multi-exchange support with real-time market data  
- Strategy customization with backtesting and simulation  
- Active open-source community and continuous development

### üìå Project: [RustDesk](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk)

**Description:**  
RustDesk is a free, open-source remote desktop software written in Rust. It provides a full-featured alternative to commercial tools like TeamViewer or AnyDesk, enabling secure remote access, desktop sharing, file transfer, and screen control. Unlike many competitors, RustDesk is completely transparent and community-driven, ensuring users retain control over their data and connections.

**Why It‚Äôs Interesting:**  
What makes RustDesk stand out is its **ease of deployment** and **flexibility**. By default, it supports both **relay (proxy) connections** and **direct peer-to-peer connections**, meaning it can work reliably across firewalls and NAT environments. For users who want full privacy and independence, hosting a personal RustDesk server is straightforward: running a single lightweight Docker container is often all it takes. This setup not only provides greater control over remote sessions but also removes the need for expensive monthly subscriptions to proprietary remote desktop software‚Äîoften saving $10 or more per month.  

RustDesk is also designed with **convenience and accessibility** in mind. Its user-friendly interface makes it approachable for non-technical users, while its cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android) ensures it fits into almost any environment. The project has an active open-source community that continuously improves stability, performance, and features.

**Tech Stack:**  
- Language: Rust (core implementation)  
- UI: Flutter for cross-platform interfaces  
- Tools: Docker, WebRTC, NAT traversal technologies  

**Key Features:**  
- üîë End-to-end encryption for secure remote sessions  
- üîÑ Support for both relay and direct P2P connections  
- üê≥ Easy self-hosting with a simple Docker container  
- üíª Cross-platform: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android  
- üìÇ File transfer, clipboard sync, and multi-monitor support  
- üåç Open-source, with an active and fast-growing community
