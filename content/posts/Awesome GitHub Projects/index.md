### ðŸ“Œ Project: [OctoBot](https://github.com/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot)

**Description:**  
OctoBot is an open-source cryptocurrency trading bot designed to provide flexible, automated trading strategies. It supports multiple exchanges, offers backtesting capabilities, and enables both beginners and advanced users to experiment with algorithmic trading.  

**Why Itâ€™s Interesting:**  
OctoBot stands out because it integrates AI-powered prediction models into trading strategies. Most notably, it allows users to connect to **custom LLMs** via a configurable base URLâ€”making it possible to use alternatives beyond OpenAI models. This flexibility includes support for local AI setups like **Ollama**, which means traders can experiment with running their own prediction models locally. Such extensibility opens the door to more privacy, cost efficiency, and creativity in designing AI-driven trading systems.  

**Tech Stack:**  
- Languages: Python  
- Tools: Docker, AsyncIO, WebSocket, REST APIs  

**Key Features:**  
- Custom **LLM base URL** for predictions (connect to any AI model, not only OpenAI)  
- Seamless integration with **Ollama** for local LLM trading predictions  
- Multi-exchange support with real-time market data  
- Strategy customization with backtesting and simulation  
- Active open-source community and continuous development
