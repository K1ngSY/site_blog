# Ark Alarm Bot V2

**Ark Alarm Bot V2** ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/K1ngSY/Ark_Alarm_V2)) is an automated monitoring and alerting tool for Windows, designed for *ARK: Survival Ascended*.  

The first generation of the project was called **ASA-Faerie** ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/K1ngSY/ASA-Faerie)). Since the initial version suffered from frequent crashes and was filled with spaghetti code (the V2 codebase is still not fully standardized but represents a significant improvement), I spent several months gradually refactoring and rewriting the project.  

This V2 version is re-implemented in **C++17** and **Qt 6.9**, leveraging **OpenCV** and **Tesseract OCR** to provide unattended game-guarding functionality.
