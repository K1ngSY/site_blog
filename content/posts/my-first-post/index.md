# Hello World 👋

This is my very first blog post built with **Hugo** and the **Congo theme**.

To begin with, this post is more of an experiment than anything else. It helps me confirm that the site is set up correctly and that all the basic features—Markdown rendering, page bundles, and local images—are working as expected.

- ✍️ Written in Markdown  
- 📦 Structured as a Page Bundle  
- 🖼️ Supports local images  

---

At the same time, I didn’t want my brand-new site to feel completely empty. A “Hello World” post feels like the perfect starting point—a small but meaningful step that marks the beginning of this blog.  

In the future, I’ll be adding more posts to introduce myself, showcase some of my projects, and share other thoughts or technical notes along the way. Hopefully, over time, this space will grow into a collection of useful and interesting content that reflects both my work and my personal interests.
