## Passion for Computer Science 💻

My journey into computer science began back in middle school. When many classmates were playing PC games, I became fascinated with the idea of building my own machine so I could join them. That curiosity led me to DIY PC build videos, and before long, I was immersed in the world of computer hardware.

By the second year of middle school, after saving up for months, I finally built my first PC. It was an unforgettable experience: learning how to install an operating system, configure drivers, and even explore workarounds for internet restrictions in mainland China. That process not only introduced me to concepts like DNS and proxies, but also sparked a lasting passion for understanding how computers truly work.

Over time, this interest grew into more than just a hobby. I started helping classmates and friends build their first PCs, guiding them from selecting components to completing their systems. Even today, I keep up with hardware news, benchmarks, and build guides—not because I own the most powerful setup, but because I love exploring, optimizing, and sharing knowledge.  

Now, as a CS student at De Anza College, I have the chance to study the field systematically, and I know for certain that computer science is not just a subject for me—it’s a discipline I want to keep exploring deeply.

## Projects 🔧

One of my most meaningful projects is **Ark Alarm Bot**, an automated monitoring and alerting tool designed for *ARK: Survival Evolved*.  

My long-term involvement with ARK inspired me to create a solution that combined image processing, automation, and error handling into a single system. What began as a way to solve challenges inside a game grew into a significant coding project, where I applied C++17, Qt, OpenCV, and OCR technologies.  

This experience taught me how to take inspiration from my personal interests and transform it into a project that required real problem-solving skills, engineering discipline, and months of iterative development.

## Broader Interests 🎮⚽📷

Beyond pure academics and projects, I have a range of interests that shaped who I am:

- **Gaming**: My gaming experiences, particularly in survival and FPS titles, taught me teamwork, perseverance, and how to adapt to challenges. These experiences also inspired me to explore automation and system design, directly influencing projects like Ark Alarm Bot.  

- **Soccer**: I started playing soccer in elementary school and continued throughout high school, often competing with classmates from different grades. Soccer gave me not only physical endurance but also lifelong friendships built through teamwork and shared passion.  

- **Photography**: In high school, I developed a love for capturing moments with a second-hand Fujifilm digital camera. Documenting campus life and fleeting scenes gave me a way to preserve memories and appreciate details in everyday life.
