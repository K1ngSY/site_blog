## Interests & Hobbies üéÆ

I‚Äôve always been passionate about gaming, and over the years I‚Äôve played many classics and popular titles.

- **GTA Series**: I grew up with *Vice City*, *San Andreas*, and of course *GTA V*.  
- **Racing Games**: I completed *Forza Horizon 4* and *Forza Horizon 5* on expert difficulty. I also enjoy driving simulators like *Euro Truck Simulator 2* and *American Truck Simulator*.  
- **FPS Games**:  
  - I was an *Overwatch 1* player for many years, starting in middle school. Sadly, I didn‚Äôt play *Overwatch 2* much after Blizzard games were suspended in China due to licensing issues.  
  - Around the same time, I also got into *PUBG*. I wasn‚Äôt the best shot and didn‚Äôt have many friends playing, but it was still a memorable part of my gaming journey.  
  - Later, I switched to *Apex Legends* when it became a global phenomenon. I started playing in late middle school and have kept at it ever since, with over **700 hours** logged. I only took a short break when the game‚Äôs popularity dipped, but otherwise it has remained one of my favorite shooters.  

- **Single-Player Games**: I love story-driven and challenging titles. I‚Äôve finished *The Witcher 3*, *Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice*, *Detroit: Become Human*, *GTA V*, and *Dying Light*.  

- **Survival Games**: During the COVID-19, I dedicated over **1400 hours** to *ARK: Survival Evolved*. Most of my time was in PvP, where I joined a large tribe with dozens of players. Together we defended our base, launched raids, and built unforgettable memories. That was probably the longest continuous stretch I‚Äôve ever spent on a single game.  
  Because I played *ARK* for such a long time, it also became one of the main inspirations for building my **Ark Alarm Bot** project later on.

Gaming has been a big part of my free time and personal growth. Whether competitive multiplayer, immersive single-player adventures, or long-term survival challenges, I‚Äôve always enjoyed diving deep into virtual worlds.

## Beyond Gaming ‚öΩüì∑

Another big part of my life, especially during high school, was soccer.  
I had been practicing the sport since I was very young‚Äîjoining my elementary school‚Äôs soccer team as early as second grade. Although I didn‚Äôt play much during middle school, things changed in high school when I met a group of classmates who were just as passionate about the game as I was.  

Every afternoon during the long recess, we would head to the field, running, sweating, and enjoying the thrill of the matches. Sometimes we even played against students from other grades, which made the experience even more exciting. Through soccer, I not only stayed active but also built strong friendships that have remained meaningful to me long after those games ended.

Apart from sports, I also developed a love for photography. I never studied it formally, but I always felt the urge to capture the world whenever I came across a beautiful scene. In high school, I bought a second-hand Fujifilm digital zoom camera, which became one of my favorite possessions. With it, I documented countless fleeting moments on campus‚Äîsunsets over the fields, candid shots of friends, and everyday details that now feel like precious memories of my school life.

These experiences in sports and photography shaped much of who I am outside of academics and gaming, giving me both lasting friendships and a way to preserve the moments that matter most.
