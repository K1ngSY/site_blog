## Interests & Hobbies 🎮

I’ve always been passionate about gaming, and over the years I’ve played many classics and popular titles.

- **GTA Series**: I grew up with *Vice City*, *San Andreas*, and of course *GTA V*.  
- **Racing Games**: I completed *Forza Horizon 4* and *Forza Horizon 5* on expert difficulty. I also enjoy driving simulators like *Euro Truck Simulator 2* and *American Truck Simulator*.  
- **FPS Games**:  
  - I was an *Overwatch 1* player for many years, starting in middle school. Sadly, I didn’t play *Overwatch 2* much after Blizzard games were suspended in China due to licensing issues.  
  - Around the same time, I also got into *PUBG*. I wasn’t the best shot and didn’t have many friends playing, but it was still a memorable part of my gaming journey.  
  - Later, I switched to *Apex Legends* when it became a global phenomenon. I started playing in late middle school and have kept at it ever since, with over **700 hours** logged. I only took a short break when the game’s popularity dipped, but otherwise it has remained one of my favorite shooters.  

- **Single-Player Games**: I love story-driven and challenging titles. I’ve finished *The Witcher 3*, *Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice*, *Detroit: Become Human*, *GTA V*, and *Dying Light*.  

- **Survival Games**: During the COVID-19, I dedicated over **1400 hours** to *ARK: Survival Evolved*. Most of my time was in PvP, where I joined a large tribe with dozens of players. Together we defended our base, launched raids, and built unforgettable memories. That was probably the longest continuous stretch I’ve ever spent on a single game.  
  Because I played *ARK* for such a long time, it also became one of the main inspirations for building my **Ark Alarm Bot** project later on.

Gaming has been a big part of my free time and personal growth. Whether competitive multiplayer, immersive single-player adventures, or long-term survival challenges, I’ve always enjoyed diving deep into virtual worlds.
