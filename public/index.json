[{"content":"Ark Alarm Bot V2 #Ark Alarm Bot V2 (GitHub repository) is an automated monitoring and alerting tool for Windows, designed for ARK: Survival Ascended.\nThe first generation of the project was called ASA-Faerie (GitHub repository). Since the initial version suffered from frequent crashes and was filled with spaghetti code (the V2 codebase is still not fully standardized but represents a significant improvement), I spent several months gradually refactoring and rewriting the project.\nThis V2 version is re-implemented in C++17 and Qt 6.9, leveraging OpenCV and Tesseract OCR to provide unattended game-guarding functionality.\nüõ† Tech Stack # C++17 Qt 6.9 OpenCV Tesseract OCR ","date":"30 August 2025","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/projects/ark-alarm-bot-v2/","section":"Posts","summary":"An automated Windows tool for ARK: Survival Ascended that uses C++17, Qt, and OCR-based image processing to provide reliable, unattended monitoring and alerts.","title":"Ark Alarm Bot V2"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/tags/posts/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/tags/projects/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Projects"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/","section":"Shunyao | Blog","summary":"","title":"Shunyao | Blog"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/projects/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Projects"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/tags/congo/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Congo"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/tags/first/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"First"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/tags/hugo/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hugo"},{"content":"Hello World üëã #This is my very first blog post built with Hugo and the Congo theme.\nI just want to\n‚úçÔ∏è Written in Markdown üì¶ Structured as a Page Bundle üñºÔ∏è Supports local images ","date":"29 August 2025","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/my-first-post/","section":"Posts","summary":"My first blog post which tests the site functionally.","title":"My First Post"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"All my blog posts","title":"Posts"},{"content":"Hi üëã I‚Äôm Shunyao.\nThis is my personal site built with Hugo + Congo.\nüéì CS student at De Anza College üíª Projects: Ark Alarm Bot(Qt C++) üåè Based in California Interests \u0026amp; Hobbies üéÆ #I‚Äôve always been passionate about gaming, and over the years I‚Äôve played many classics and popular titles.\nGTA Series: I grew up with Vice City, San Andreas, and of course GTA V.\nRacing Games: I completed Forza Horizon 4 and Forza Horizon 5 on expert difficulty. I also enjoy driving simulators like Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator.\nFPS Games:\nI was an Overwatch 1 player for many years, starting in middle school. Sadly, I didn‚Äôt play Overwatch 2 much after Blizzard games were suspended in China due to licensing issues. Around the same time, I also got into PUBG. I wasn‚Äôt the best shot and didn‚Äôt have many friends playing, but it was still a memorable part of my gaming journey. Later, I switched to Apex Legends when it became a global phenomenon. I started playing in late middle school and have kept at it ever since, with over 700 hours logged. I only took a short break when the game‚Äôs popularity dipped, but otherwise it has remained one of my favorite shooters. Single-Player Games: I love story-driven and challenging titles. I‚Äôve finished The Witcher 3, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Detroit: Become Human, GTA V, and Dying Light.\nSurvival Games: During the COVID-19, I dedicated over 1400 hours to ARK: Survival Evolved. Most of my time was in PvP, where I joined a large tribe with dozens of players. Together we defended our base, launched raids, and built unforgettable memories. That was probably the longest continuous stretch I‚Äôve ever spent on a single game.\nBecause I played ARK for such a long time, it also became one of the main inspirations for building my Ark Alarm Bot project later on.\nGaming has been a big part of my free time and personal growth. Whether competitive multiplayer, immersive single-player adventures, or long-term survival challenges, I‚Äôve always enjoyed diving deep into virtual worlds.\n","date":"29 August 2025","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/about/","section":"Shunyao | Blog","summary":"","title":"About"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/tags/intro/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Intro"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/tags/personal/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Personal"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"}]
