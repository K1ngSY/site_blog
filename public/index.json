[{"content":"Ark Alarm Bot V2 #Ark Alarm Bot V2 (GitHub repository) is an automated monitoring and alerting tool for Windows, designed for ARK: Survival Ascended.\nThe first generation of the project was called ASA-Faerie (GitHub repository). Since the initial version suffered from frequent crashes and was filled with spaghetti code (the V2 codebase is still not fully standardized but represents a significant improvement), I spent several months gradually refactoring and rewriting the project.\nThis V2 version is re-implemented in C++17 and Qt 6.9, leveraging OpenCV and Tesseract OCR to provide unattended game-guarding functionality.\nüõ† Tech Stack # C++17 Qt 6.9 OpenCV Tesseract OCR ","date":"30 August 2025","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/projects/ark-alarm-bot-v2/","section":"Posts","summary":"An automated Windows tool for ARK: Survival Ascended that uses C++17, Qt, and OCR-based image processing to provide reliable, unattended monitoring and alerts.","title":"Ark Alarm Bot V2"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/tags/posts/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/tags/projects/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Projects"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/","section":"Shunyao | Blog","summary":"","title":"Shunyao | Blog"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/projects/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Projects"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/tags/congo/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Congo"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/tags/first/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"First"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/tags/hugo/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hugo"},{"content":"Hello World üëã #This is my very first blog post built with Hugo and the Congo theme.\nTo begin with, this post is more of an experiment than anything else.

When many classmates were playing PC games, I became fascinated with the idea of building my own machine so I could join them. That curiosity led me to DIY PC build videos, and before long, I was immersed in the world of computer hardware.\nBy the second year of middle school, after saving up for months, I finally built my first PC. It was an unforgettable experience: learning how to install an operating system, configure drivers, and even explore workarounds for internet restrictions in mainland China. That process not only introduced me to concepts like DNS and proxies, but also sparked a lasting passion for understanding how computers truly work.\nOver time, this interest grew into more than just a hobby. I started helping classmates and friends build their first PCs, guiding them from selecting components to completing their systems. Even today, I keep up with hardware news, benchmarks, and build guides‚Äînot because I own the most powerful setup, but because I love exploring, optimizing, and sharing knowledge.\nNow, as a CS student at De Anza College, I have the chance to study the field systematically, and I know for certain that computer science is not just a subject for me‚Äîit‚Äôs a discipline I want to keep exploring deeply.\nProjects üîß #One of my most meaningful projects is Ark Alarm Bot, an automated monitoring and alerting tool designed for ARK: Survival Evolved.\nMy long-term involvement with ARK inspired me to create a solution that combined image processing, automation, and error handling into a single system. What began as a way to solve challenges inside a game grew into a significant coding project, where I applied C++17, Qt, OpenCV, and OCR technologies.\nThis experience taught me how to take inspiration from my personal interests and transform it into a project that required real problem-solving skills, engineering discipline, and months of iterative development.\nBroader Interests üéÆ‚öΩüì∑ #Beyond pure academics and projects, I have a range of interests that shaped who I am:\nGaming: My gaming experiences, particularly in survival and FPS titles, taught me teamwork, perseverance, and how to adapt to challenges. These experiences also inspired me to explore automation and system design, directly influencing projects like Ark Alarm Bot.\nSoccer: I started playing soccer in elementary school and continued throughout high school, often competing with classmates from different grades. Soccer gave me not only physical endurance but also lifelong friendships built through teamwork and shared passion.\nPhotography: In high school, I developed a love for capturing moments with a second-hand Fujifilm digital camera. Documenting campus life and fleeting scenes gave me a way to preserve memories and appreciate details in everyday life.\nClosing Thoughts ‚ú® #From building PCs and studying computer science, to developing projects inspired by personal interests, to the friendships made through sports and photography‚Äîeach of these experiences reflects my curiosity, creativity, and persistence.\nThis blog is my space to continue sharing that journey: my projects, my passions, and the lessons I learn along the way.\n","date":"29 August 2025","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/about/","section":"Shunyao | Blog","summary":"","title":"About"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/tags/intro/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Intro"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/tags/personal/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Personal"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"}]
